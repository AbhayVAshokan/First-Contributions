Hello Coder!

Help me build this awesome repository!
Only programming stuff allowed here!
Contribute almost anything....
Let's see how many contributors we will get in a month time!

Too many junk files were deleted. Cloning this repo might pull all useless files taking a long time. Instead clone using this command. It pulls only the latest commit.
```
git clone https://github.com/AbhayVAshokan/First-Contributions.git --depth=1
```
